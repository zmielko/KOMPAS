KOMPAS is a novel transcription factor binding site calling algorithm that utilizes high-throughput kmer data. It is composed of two scripts:
1. align.py
2. sitecall.py

align.py aligns kmers from universal protein binding microarray data and outputs an aligned kmer file. This file can be used by sitecall.py to call binding sites. 

kompasPKG is a beta version of the package that can be installed, after unzipping, via `pip install -e kompasPKG`

For more information on using KOMPAS, see the documentation on the repo wiki.
